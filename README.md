# Good README Generator

I have created a README generator that quickly creates a professional README for a new project, and accepts user input from the command line.

When the user is prompted for information about their application repository a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of their project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When the user enters their project title it is displayed as the title of the README. When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then that information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. When the user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. When the user enters their GitHub username, then it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile. When the user enters their email address it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions. When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Content then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
